                <p>You can choose any style, any colour including mixed colours or clear resin with glitter or no glitter. Flowers can be added in your chosen colours, and each piece can include names and dates.</p>
                <p>We can also incorporate pearls, beads, diamantes, collars (providing they are not too large), and many other personal items. If you have your own ideas, we will do our very best to bring your vision to life.</p>
                <p>Every memorial piece can be made free-standing or drilled to hang on the wall. Our resin is high quality, fade-proof, heat-proof, and waterproof, ensuring your keepsake lasts for years to come.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">Our Story</h2>
                <p>I would like to share a short story about why I began creating personalised resin products.</p>
                <p>In July 2020, I lost my beloved dog. I was so upset and overwhelmed that I did not think to keep a lock of his hair, his paw print, or even a small amount of his ashes as a keepsake. Instead, I sewed his ashes into a teddy bear so I could hug him at night.</p>
                <p>Looking back, I would have loved to have his photo, ashes, fur, or paw print preserved in a beautiful resin piece, something I could display in my home or hang on the wall. That experience inspired me to help others create lasting memorials for their loved ones.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">Personalisation &amp; Ordering</h2>
                <p>Each memorial item can include a name and date, personalised directly onto the piece. You are also welcome to write a special message to your loved one or pet, place it in a small bottle, and we can incorporate it into your personalised item.</p>
                <p>We provide bottles and paw-print pads free of charge for your beloved pet. If ashes or fur need to be posted to us, a signed-for delivery service is required due to the delicate nature of these items.</p>
                <p>I keep my prices as low as possible, as I do this for satisfaction and to help families preserve precious memories.</p>
