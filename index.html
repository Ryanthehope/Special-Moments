                <h2 class="sub-heading">My Story</h2>
                <p>In July 2020, I lost my beloved dog. I was so upset and overwhelmed that I did not think to keep a lock of his hair, his paw print, or even a small amount of his ashes as a keepsake. Instead, I sewed his ashes into a teddy bear so I could hug him at night. Looking back, I would have had loved to have his photo, ashes, fur, or paw print preserved in a beautiful resin piece, something I could display in my home or hang on the wall. That experience inspired me to help others create lasting memorials for their loved ones.</p>
                <p>At Special Moments, I create beautiful keepsake memories, carefully preserved in high-quality epoxy resin. I work closely with you to design a unique, personalised piece that tells your story. Whether you are looking for a small or medium photo memorial, or a bespoke table for your bedroom or lounge, each creation is made with care and attention to detail. </p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">How It Works</h2>
                <p>You can choose any style, any colour including mixed colours or clear resin with glitter or no glitter. Flowers can be added in your chosen colours, and each piece can include names and dates. I can also incorporate pearls, beads, diamantes, collars (providing they are not too large), and many other personal items. If you have your own ideas, I will do my very best to bring your vision to life.</p>
                <p>Every memorial piece can be made free-standing or drilled to hang on the wall. My resin is high quality, fade-proof, heat-proof, and waterproof, ensuring your keepsake lasts for years to come.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">Personalisation &amp; Ordering</h2>
                <p>Each memorial item can include a name and date, personalised directly onto the piece. You are also welcome to write a special message to your loved one or pet, place it in a small bottle, and I can incorporate it into your personalised item. I provide bottles and paw-print pads free of charge for your beloved pet. If ashes or fur need to be posted to us, a signed-for delivery service is required due to the delicate nature of these items.</p>
                <p>I keep my prices as low as possible, as I do this for satisfaction and to help families preserve precious memories.</p>
